# OneKey Reference Consent Management Platform (CMP) UI

# Overview

The output from this project is a single JavaScript resource file that contains the entire CMP.

The functionality requires a CMP provider that has enabled CORS access from the publisher or advertiser domain. The host
name of this CMP provider will be needed before deploying the CMP UI.

# For Publishers and Advertisers

The script adds the HTML elements to the DOM at the point it is included. It should be a blocking include to render the
UI as soon as possible and enable the web site to continue loading and fetching data whilst the user interacts with the 
dialogue. All the resources needed to provide the UI are embedded in the single small JavaScript resource.

## Languages

JavaScript bundles are created for the specific supported languages. There are two options for selecting the language.

1. Replace `[-lang code]` tag in the example URLs with the most appropriate language code using server side code.
2. Remove the `[-lang code]` tag so that the file requested is `ok-ui.js`. The most appropriate language will be determined client side.

The use of server side logic to perform the language identification will provide the best performance. The logic for 
language detection can be model on the `./src/loader.ts` script.

## Performance (1)

To improve overall performance a preload link element should be added at the beginning of the `<head>` element. This 
will commence fetching the JavaScript resource as soon as possible in the page render process. This will be 
particularly noticeable when HTTPS/2 is used.

```html
<link rel="preload" as="script" href="https://domain.com/assets/cmp/ok-ui[-lang code].js">
```

If this link is not added then the functionality will still be provided but page load time will be marginally impaired.

## Script

The script element and attributes must be added to the `<body>` element. See the following example.

```html
<script src="https://domain.com/assets/cmp/ok-ui[-lang code].js" 
    data-display-intro="true"
    data-snackbar-timeout-ms="5000" 
    data-proxy-host-name="cmp.pafdemopublisher.com" 
    data-brand-name="CMP PAF Demo Pub"
    data-site-only-cookie-tcf-core="pub-tcf"
    data-mode="cors" // Only used if the lang-code is not present in the URL
    data-brand-privacy-url="https://github.com/prebid/paf-mvp-implementation"></script>
```

The DOM is modified at the point the script is included. There are no other deployment options.

### Performance (2)

By placing the script element for the CMP as close to the top of the `<body>` element as possible the interface will 
appear on first request while the rest of the page is loading behind it. Should the interface require a redirect to 
fetch or store data then the assets for the publishers page will already be cached by the web browser effectively 
improving user perceive page load time. Also the approach is likely to improve actual page load time compared to 
solutions which load the interface after other page processing completes.

## Configuration options

The following attributes must be present in the script tag.

- data-brand-name: The brand name to use throughout the user interface.
- data-brand-privacy-url: This URL is needed to inform the user about the privacy policy of the brand.
- data-display-intro: True to display the introduction card, or false to skip straight to the settings card after a possible redirect.
- data-mode: If the script needs to determine the language this value is used with the Fetch API to set the mode attribute when checking to determine if the preferred language is supported. If left empty defaults to `cors`.
- data-proxy-host-name: The host name to use when reading and writing data from the global storage.
- data-site-only-cookie-tcf-core: The name of the cookie used to store the TCF core string. If not provided then the this site only option is not available.
- data-snackbar-timeout-ms: The number of milliseconds to wait for the snackbar to disappear.
- data-template-tcf-core-string: The [template TCF core string](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md?msclkid=5236f9f5c47b11ec8a04e36f3dd976c9#the-core-string) that will be used when generating the resulting TCF core string from the CMP. This project will change the Purposes Consents, Created, and LastUpdated fields of the provided value when writing the TCF core string to the cookie. See [IAB TCF](https://iabtcf.com/#/encode) web site to generate this value.

If these are invalid, or not provided where mandatory, then errors are written to the console and the UI will not function.

# For Developers

## Languages

Language variants are provided in the `./src/locales` folder where the name of the YAML file relates to the common
language code. The `./src/locales` class should be updated to reference all the possible locales. The required fields
are defined in the class. The US english locale is used where specific text is not provided.

## Views

HTML snippets are available as views in the `./src/views` folder. They are taken from the associated Storybook pattern
library. The `./src/view` class handles the selection and application of the current locale.

The CSS, images, and JS needed by the views is included in the `./src/css`, `./src/images` and `./src/script` folders.
These are embedded in the the resource as strings and added to the DOM when the UI is loaded. There are no external
dependent resources.

## Model

The data model is contained in the class `./src/model`. Two way binding between the view cards and the data model is
supported. Each field supports multiple bindings to UI elements for different purposes. For example the preference field
binds to HTML text elements, radio buttons, and multiple custom settings for specific marketing choices. The generic 
`./src/binding` and `./src/fields` classes support the model.

## Controller
 
`./src/controller` implements the controller for the UI, references the other classes, and the dependent project paf-lib.
The primary logic relates to loading the UI and fetching the current data state from the paf-lib in the constructor. It
also handles actions and changes to the current displayed card.

## Actions

HTML `<button>` and `a` tags in views that have the following data attributes are bound to actions in the controller.

- data-card: changes the currently displayed card to the value provided. Allowed card names match the file names in the ./views folder.
- data-action: one of the listed actions. Other values are ignored.

The following lists the allowed values for data-action.

- save: saves the model to persistent storage.
- refresh: refreshes the data from the global storage.
- refuseAll: flags that the solution has been rejected for the domain in question.
- reset: rests the random identifier.
